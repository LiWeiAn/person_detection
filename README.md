# person_detection
This repository is created for my master's thesis project. Person detection is performed with MobileNet + SSD downloaded through the TensorFlow model zoo: [https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md]
The approach is detecting people on raw RGB images published a ROS topic.
